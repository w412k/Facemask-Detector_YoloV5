# Facemask-Detector_YoloV5
I developed and trained a face mask detector using the YOLOv5 algorithm. This detector is designed to identify and classify whether a person is wearing a face mask. This project contributes to the ongoing efforts in promoting public health and safety by automating the process of monitoring face mask compliance.
